// =================================================================
// DirectX functionality required to manage D3D surfaces
//

// Create DirectX 11 device context
// - Required when using D3D surfaces.
// - D3D Device created and handed to Intel Media SDK
// - Intel graphics device adapter will be determined automatically (does not have to be primary),
//   but with the following caveats:
//     - Device must be active (but monitor does NOT have to be attached)
//     - Device must be enabled in BIOS. Required for the case when used together with a discrete graphics card
//     - For switchable graphics solutions (mobile) make sure that Intel device is the active device
