# Intel® Media SDK
Intel® Media SDK provides an API to access hardware-accelerated video decode, encode and filtering on Intel® platforms with integrated graphics.

**Supported video encoders**: HEVC, AVC, MPEG-2, JPEG  
**Supported Video decoders**: HEVC, AVC, VP8, MPEG-2, VC1, JPEG  
**Supported video pre-processing filters**: Color Conversion, Deinterlace, Denoise, Resize, Rotate, Composition

# Important note
The current version of Intel Media SDK is compatible with the open source [Intel Media Driver for VAAPI](https://github.com/intel/media-driver).
Intel Media SDK depends on [LibVA](https://github.com/01org/libva/).

# Products which use Media SDK

* [Intel Media Server Studio](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-media-server-studio)
* [Intel Media SDK for Embedded Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/media-sdk/choose-download/embedded-iot)

# System requirements

**Operating System:** Linux

**Software:**
* [LibVA](https://github.com/intel/libva)
* VAAPI backend driver:
  * [Intel Media Driver for VAAPI](https://github.com/intel/media-driver)
* Some features require CM Runtime library (part of [Intel Media Driver for VAAPI](https://github.com/intel/media-driver) package)

**Hardware:** Intel platforms supported by the [Intel Media Driver for VAAPI](https://github.com/intel/media-driver)

Media SDK test and sample applications may require additional software packages (for example, X Server, Wayland, LibDRM, etc.) to be functional.

# How to build
## Requirements
 - Git* (with [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) support)
 - Cmake* v2.8+
 - GCC* v4.8+
 - [LibVA](https://github.com/intel/libva)

## Build steps

Get sources:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK msdk
cd msdk
```

Configure and build as follows:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```
This will build MSDK binaries and MSDK samples. The following cmake configuration options can be used to customize the build:

| Option | Values | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| API | master\|latest\|major.minor | Build mediasdk library with specified API. 'latest' will enable experimental features. 'master' will configure the most recent available published API (that's the default). |

## Enabling Instrumentation and Tracing Technology
To enable the Instrumentation and Tracing Technology API you need either Intel® VTune™ Amplifier installed or to manually build an open source version. You can get ITT source files from [GitHub](https://github.com/01org/IntelSEAPI/tree/master/ittnotify) and build it on your own.

**Please note** that auto detection of the Intel VTune Amplifier configuration is not supported. The next step is mandatory if you want to use this feature: set `$ITT_PATH` so `$ITT_PATH/include/ittnotify.h` and `$ITT_PATH/libittnotify64.a` will be valid paths. MSDK build system will automatically detect it.
