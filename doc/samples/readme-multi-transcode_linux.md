# Multi-Transcoding Sample

## Overview

**Multi-Transcoding Sample** works with **Intel® Media SDK** \(hereinafter referred to as "**SDK**"\)

It demonstrates how to use **SDK** API to create a console application that performs the transcoding \(decoding and encoding\) of a video stream from one compressed video format to another, with optional video processing \(resizing\) of uncompressed video prior to encoding. The application supports multiple input and output streams meaning it can execute multiple transcoding sessions concurrently.

The main goal of this sample is to demonstrate CPU/GPU balancing in order to get maximum throughput on Intel® hardware-accelerated platforms \(with encoding support\). This is achieved by running several transcoding pipelines in parallel and fully loading both CPU and GPU.

This sample also demonstrates integration of user-defined functions for video processing \(picture rotation plug-in\) into **SDK** transcoding pipeline.

This version of sample also demonstrates surface type neutral transcoding \(opaque memory usage\).

The sample is able to work with **HEVC Decoder & Encoder** \(hereinafter referred to as "**HEVC**"\).

## Features

**Multi-Transcoding Sample** supports the following video formats:

|Format type| |
|---|---|
| input \(compressed\) | H.264 \(AVC, MVC – Multi-View Coding\), MPEG-2 video, VC-1, JPEG\*/Motion JPEG, HEVC \(High Efficiency Video Coding\), VP8, VP9, AV1 |
| output \(compressed\) | H.264 \(AVC, MVC – Multi-View Coding\), MPEG-2 video, JPEG\*/Motion JPEG, HEVC \(High Efficiency Video Coding\), VP9 |

The command-line interface allows 2 usage models \(which can be mixed within one parameter file\):

1.  Multiple intra-session transcoding: several transcoding sessions, any number of sessions can be joined. Each session includes decoding, preprocessing \(optional\), and encoding.
2.  Multiple inter-session transcoding: output of a single decoding session serves as input for several encoding sessions. Either all or none of the sessions are joined. Any of the encoding sessions can optionally include preprocessing \(resizing\).

Below are several examples of parameter file contents.

Single intra-session transcoding:

```
-i::vc1 input.vc1 -async 10 -o::h264 output.h264 –n 100 –w 320 –h 240 –f 30 –b 2000 –u speed
```

Multiple intra-session transcoding, several sessions joined:

```
-i::vc1 input1.vc1 -async 10 -o::mpeg2 output1.mpeg2
-i::h264 input2.h264 -o::mpeg2 output2.mpeg2 –join
-i::h264 input3.h264 -o::mpeg2 output3.mpeg2 –join
```

Multiple inter-session transcoding, all sessions joined:

```
-i::h264 input.h264 -o::sink –join
-o::mpeg2 output1.mpeg2 -i::source –join –w 640 –h 480
-o::mpeg2 output2.mpeg2 -async 2 -u 3 -i::source -join
```

Mixed model:

```
-i::vc1 input.vc1 -async 10 -o::h264 output.h264 –n 100 –w 320 –h 240 –f 30 –b 2000 –u speed
-hw -i::h264 input.h264 -o::sink –join
-o::mpeg2 output1.mpeg2 -i::source –join –w 640 –h 480
-o::mpeg2 output2.mpeg2 -async 2 -u 3 -i::source –join
```

Single intra-session MVC transcoding:

```
-i::mvc input.mvc -async 10 -o::mvc output.mvc –n 100 –w 320 –h 240 –f 30 –b 2000 –u speed
```

Please, also pay attention on “Running the Software” section of [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md) document where you will find important notes on backend specific usage \(drm and x11\).

## ROI file format description

ROI file has the following format:
```
roi_count_frame_1;
    roi1_left1; roi1_top1; roi1_right1; roi1_bottom1; roi1_dqp1;
    roi2_left1; roi2_top1; roi2_right1; roi2_bottom1; roi2_dqp1;
roi_count_frame_2;
    roi1_left2; roi1_top2; roi1_right2; roi1_bottom2; roi1_dqp2;
    roi2_left2; roi2_top2; roi2_right2; roi2_bottom2; roi2_dqp2;
roi_count_frame_n;
    roi1_leftn; roi1_topn; roi1_rightn; roi1_bottomn; roi1_dqpn;
    roi2_leftn; roi2_topn; roi2_rightn; roi2_bottomn; roi2_dqpn;
    ...
```

Values are separated by semicolons. Each entry starts with a count that represents the ROI information for a single frame. The count indicates the number of (5 entry) ROI descriptions provided for the frame (up to 256 ROIs).

Example: a ROI file for a two frame stream where the first frame has two ROIs with -8 and 5 delta QP values, and the second frame includes three ROIs with -8, 8, and -4 delta QP values:

```
2;
    1104;592;1216;928;-8;
    1200;544;1504;848; 5;
3;
    1088;576;1200;912;-8;
    1200;528;1488;832; 8;
    944; 400;1264;512;-4;
```

**Tips**

1.  To achieve maximum throughput use `–async` >= 5 and the –join option when running several transcoding pipelines.
2.  If you need only one transcoding session you can avoid creating a par file and pass the arguments of this session to the application using command line. E.g.:

```
sample_multi_transcode -i::mpeg2 input.mpeg2 -async 10 -o::h264 output.h264
–n 100 –w 320 –h 240 –f 30 –b 2000 –u speed -p 1.perf –hw
```

## HEVC Plugins

HEVC codec is implemented as a plugin unlike codecs such as MPEG2 and AVC. There are 3 implementations of HEVC: Hardware or GPU \(HW\), Software or CPU \(SW\) for both decode and encode and GPU-Accelerated \(GACC\) only for encoder.

**Note 1:** The HEVC SW and GACC plugins are available only in the HEVC package which is part of the Intel® Media Software Development Kit 2018. You can find the available plugins and their IDs from `$MFX_ROOT/include/mfxplugin.h` file.

**Note 2:** HW plugins for HEVC encode and decode are supported starting from 6th Generation of Intel CoreTM Processors, Intel® Xeon® E3-1200 and E3-1500 v5 Family with Intel® Processor Graphics 500 Series \(codename Skylake\).

**Note 3:** Multi-transcoding sample loads the HW HEVC plugins with HW library and SW plugins with SW library by default. You can enforce a plugin to be loaded by specifying its hexadecimal GUID or path using "-pe" parameter for encode plugins and "-pd" parameter for decode plugins. If you need to run one plugin for multiple sessions, use "set" option.

At the example below multi-transcoding sample runs HW library with HW decode and encode plugins:

```
sample_multi_transcode -i::h265 input.265 -o::h265 out.h265 -w 480 -h 320
```

The following command line loads SW lib and SW plugins:

```
sample_multi_transcode -i::h265 input.265 -o::h265 out.h265 -w 480 -h 320 -sw
```

This is an example how to use HW library with SW plugins:

```
sample_multi_transcode -i::h265 ../content/test_stream.265 -pd 15dd936825ad475ea34e35f3f54217a6 -o::h265 out.h265 -w 480 -h 320 -pe 2fca99749fdb49aeb121a5b63ef568f7
```

HW library+SW decoder+GACC encoder:

```
sample_multi_transcode -i::h265 ../content/test_stream.265 -pd 15dd936825ad475ea34e35f3f54217a6 -o::h265 out.h265 -w 480 -h 320 -pe e5400a06c74d41f5b12d430bbaa23d0b
```

Multiple intra-session transcoding with the same SW HEVC plugin is used in both cases:

```
set -i::h265 15dd936825ad475ea34e35f3f54217a6
-i::h265 input1.265 -o::h264 output1.264
-i::h265 input2.265 -o::mpeg2 output2.mpeg2
```

Multiple intra-session transcoding using set clause:

```
set -i::h265 /path/to/so/decoder_plugin.so
set -o::h265 /path/to/so/encoder_plugin.so
-i::h265 input1.265 -o::h264 output1.264
-i::mpeg2 input2.mpeg2 -o::h265 output2.265
```

## Known Limitations

-   To use lookahead for HEVC encode, we need to have h264 LA plugin and the HEVC HW encode plugin, run in separate sessions. Following par file is an example of lookahead bitrate for HEVC encode:
    ```
    -i::h265 input.h265 -o::sink  -hw -async 1 -la -la_ext -bpyr -dist 8 -join
    -i::source -o::h265 output.h265 -u 4 -hw -b 500 -async 1 -bpyr -dist 8 -join
    ```

-   Configurations <multiple joined inter-session transcoding where one of the encoders is MPEG2\> are not supported when sample application uses platform-specific **SDK** implementation on systems with Intel® HD Graphics 3000/2000 and 4000/2500. Application can exit with error or hang. An example of a corresponding par file is given below:

    ```
    -i::h264 input.h264 -o::sink –join
    -o::mpeg2 output1.mpeg2 -i::source –join
    -o::h264 output2.h264 -i::source –join
    ```

    Systems with Intel® Iris™ Pro Graphics, Intel® Iris™ Graphics and Intel® HD Graphics 4200+ Series are free from this limitation.

-   Picture rotation sample plug-ins do not swap view order in the pipeline with MVC encoder. This should be considered if viewing of the output video is involved.

-   In case of using HEVC plugin \(h265 video type\), plugin type \(hardware or software\) used by default is set depending on -sw or -hw sample options. However, hardware HEVC plugins work on specific platforms only. To force usage of specific HEVC plugin implementation, please use -pe and -pd options with proper plugin GUID.
-   SW HEVC plugin in 10bit mode cannot be used together with HW library VPP. Although library allows that, this is bad practice because additional per-pixel data shift is required. Please use HW HEVC + HW library or SW HEVC + SW library instead.
-   Sample may crash if composition filter is used with more than 10 sources \(because of limitations in MSDK library\).
-   -timeout option set in command line together with par file name may work incorrectly. Please use -timeout option set inside par file instead.
-   Sample may not function properly on systems that have a non-Intel VGA controller as the first \(primary\) because Intel device is not first in the list.

    To workaround this issue, swap names of DRI device files:

    `$ cd /dev && mv card0 tmp && mv card1 card0 && mv tmp card1`

    and do the same for the files `control64/65` and `renderD128/129`

-   In case of inter-session transcoding \(with separate decoding and encoding sessions\) -n option should be set both for sessions to get exact number of output frames.
