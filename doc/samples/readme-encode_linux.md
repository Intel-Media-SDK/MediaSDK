# Encoding Sample

## Overview

**Encoding Sample** works with **Intel® Media SDK** \(hereinafter referred to as "**SDK**"\).

It demonstrates how to use the **SDK** API to create a simple console application that performs preprocessing and encoding of an uncompressed video stream according to a specific video compression standard. Also the sample shows how to integrate user-defined functions for video processing \(on example of picture rotation plug-in\) into **SDK** encoding pipeline.

The sample is able to work with**HEVC Decoder & Encoder** \(hereinafter referred to as "**HEVC**"\).

**Note:** To run HEVC, please read the instructions in the “HEVC Plugin” section carefully.

## Features

**Encoding Sample** supports the following video formats:

|Format type| |
|---|---|
| input \(uncompressed\) | YUV420, NV12 |
| output \(compressed\) | H.264 \(AVC, MVC – Multi-View Coding\), H.265 \(with **HEVC**\), MPEG-2 video, JPEG\*/Motion JPEG, HEVC \(High Efficiency Video Coding\) |

**Note**: For format YUV420, **Encoding Sample** assumes the order Y, U, V in the input file.

## Hardware Requirements

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

## Software Requirements

## How to Build the Application

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

To enable V4L2 option during compilation, set --enable-v4l2=yes option while running `build.pl`

Below are examples of a command-line to execute **Encoding Sample**:
```
$ sample_encode h264 -i input.yuv -o output.h264 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –f 30 –u quality –d3d –hw
$ sample_encode mpeg2 -i input.yuv -o output.mpeg2 –w 1920 –h 1080 –b 15000 -u speed –nv12 –tff -hw
$ sample_encode h264 -i input.yuv -o output.h264 –w 1920 –h 1080 –dstw 360 –dsth 240 –b 1000 –u balanced -hw
```

**Note 1:** You need to have **HEVC** installed to run with h265 codec. In case of HW library it will firstly try to load HW HEVC plugin in case of failure - it will try SW one if available.

**Tip:**

To achieve better performance, use input streams in NV12 color format. If the input stream is in YUV420 format, each frame is converted to NV12 which reduces overall performance.

## HEVC Encode Plugins

HEVC codec is implemented as a plugin unlike codecs such as MPEG2 and AVC. There are 3 implementations of HEVC encoder: Hardware \(HW\), Software \(SW\) and GPU-Accelerated \(GACC\) plugins.

**Note 1:** The HEVC SW and GACC plugins are available only in the HEVC package which is part of the Intel® Media Software Development Kit 2018. You can find the available plugins and their IDs from `$MFX_ROOT/include/mfxplugin.h` file.

**Note 2:** HW plugin for HEVC encode is supported starting from 6th Generation of Intel CoreTM Processors, Intel® Xeon® E3-1200 and E3-1500 v5 Family with Intel® Processor Graphics 500 Series \(codename Skylake\).

**Note 3:** Encoding sample loads the HW HEVC encode plugin with HW library and SW encode with SW library by default. You can enforce a plugin to be loaded by specifying the plugin ID using "-p" parameter and hexadecimal GUID.

Examples of running HW HEVC encoder with HW library:

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –f 30 –u quality
```

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –f 30 –u quality -hw
```

Different ways to run SW HEVC encoder \(the first example uses SW library, the second one uses HW library\):

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –f 30 –u quality -sw
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –f 30 –u quality -p 2fca99749fdb49aeb121a5b63ef568f7
```

To run the HEVC GACC encoder, you have to specify the “-p” parameter with GUID. Please note that GACC plugin works only with HW library.

The following command-lines will force sample to use the HEVC GACC Encode plugin:

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –p e5400a06c74d41f5b12d430bbaa23d0b
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 –w 720 –h 480 –b 10000 –p e5400a06c74d41f5b12d430bbaa23d0b -hw
```

To run HEVC plugins in 10 bit mode, you have to specify the “-ec::p010” or "-p010" option:

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.yuv -o output.h265 -w 720 -h 480 -b 10000 -ec::p010
```

```
$ sample_encode h265 -i input.p010 -o output.h265 -w 720 -h 480 -b 10000 -p010
```

## Known Limitations

-   Not all combinations of optional switches are supported. If the option `–angle 180` or `–opencl` is specified, options `-tff|bff, -dstw, -dsth, -d3d` and MVC output are not available.

-   **Encoding Sample** if run with `–opencl` option requires input video frame width to be aligned by 4.

-   In case of using HEVC plugin \(h265 video type\), plugin type \(hardware or software\) used by default is set depending on -sw or -hw sample options. However, hardware HEVC plugins work on specific platforms only. To force usage of specific HEVC plugin implementation, please use -p option with proper plugin GUID.
-   Sample may not function properly on systems that have a non-Intel VGA controller as the first \(primary\) because Intel device is not first in the list.

    To workaround this issue, swap names of DRI device files:

    `$ cd /dev && mv card0 tmp && mv card1 card0 && mv tmp card1`

    and do the same for the files `control64/65` and `renderD128/129`

-   HECV 10Bit encoding works with HEVC SW plugin only due to library limitations
