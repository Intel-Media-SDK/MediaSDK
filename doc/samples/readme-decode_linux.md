# Decoding Sample

## Overview

**Decoding Sample** works with **Intel® Media SDK** \(hereinafter referred to as "**SDK**"\).

It demonstrates how to use the **SDK** API to create a sample console application that performs decoding of various video compression formats.

The sample is able to work with **HEVC Decoder & Encoder** \(hereinafter referred to as "**HEVC**"\).

**Note:** To run HEVC, please read the instructions in the “HEVC Plugin” section carefully.

## Features

**Decoding Sample** supports the following video formats:

|Format type| |
|---|---|
| input \(compressed\) | H.264 \(AVC, MVC – Multi-View Coding\), MPEG-2 video, VC-1, JPEG\*/Motion JPEG, HEVC \(High Efficiency Video Coding\), VP8, AV1 |
| output \(uncompressed\) | YUV420 |

**Note 2: Decoding Sample** renders the decoded video stream to a file in YUV 4:2:0 sampling format, with the color planes Y, U and V in that order.

## Hardware Requirements

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

## Software Requirements

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

## How to Build the Application

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

## Running the Software

See [`<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md`](./Media_Samples_Guide_Linux.md).

The executable file requires the following command-line switches to function properly:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| h265\|h264\|mpeg2\|vc1\|vp8\|mvc\|jpeg\|av1 |Input video type. This is an elementary video stream. The use of option h265 is possible only if corresponding plugins are installed. |
| -i <InputFile\> | Input \(compressed\) video file, name and path. |
| -o <Output\> | Specifies output \(YUV\) video file\(s\), name and path. With MVC, specify the file name without extension to use as a pattern. The sample creates several output files with names such as “filename\_N.yuv” according to the number of views in the MVC stream. |

The following command-line switches are optional:

**Note 1:** You need to have **HEVC** installed to run with h265 codec. In case of HW library \(-sw key is not specified\) it will firstly try to load HW plugin, in case of failure - it will try SW one if available.

Below are examples of a command-line to execute **Decoding Sample**:

`$ sample_decode h264 -i input.h264 -o output.yuv -hw`

Please, also pay attention on “Running the Software” section of `<install-folder>/Media_Samples_Guide.md` document where you will find important notes on backend specific usage \(drm and x11\).

## HEVC Decode Plugins

HEVC codec is implemented as a plugin unlike codecs such as MPEG2 and AVC. We provide 2 implementations of the HEVC decoders: Software \(SW\) and Hardware \(HW\).

**Note 1:** The HEVC SW plugin is available in the HEVC package which is part of the Intel® Media Software Development Kit 2018. You can find the available plugins and their IDs from `$MFX_ROOT/include/mfxplugin.h` file.

**Note 2:** HW plugin for HEVC Decode is supported starting from 6th Generation of Intel CoreTM Processors, Intel® Xeon® E3-1200 and E3-1500 v5 Family with Intel® Processor Graphics 500 Series \(codename Skylake\).

**Note 3:** Decoding sample loads the HW HEVC decode plugin with HW library and SW decode with SW library by default. You can enforce a plugin to be loaded by specifying the plugin ID using "-p" parameter and hexadecimal GUID.

Examples of using HW HEVC decoder and HW library:

```
$ sample_decode h265 -i input.265 -o output.yuv
$ sample_decode h265 -i input.265 -o output.yuv -hw
```

Examples of SW HEVC decoder usage \(the first instance loads SW library, the second one HW library\):

```
$ sample_decode h265 -i input.265 -o output.yuv -sw
$ sample_decode h265 -i input.265 -o output.yuv –p 33a61cb4c27454ca8d85dde757c6f8e
```

## Known Limitations

-   **Decoding Sample** does not fully decode some video streams from a networked folder. Instead, copy the input file to local storage prior to decoding.

-   **Decoding Sample** renders output in the simplest way. The rendering window does not support time stamps, aspect ratio.

-   Decoding Sample cannot render P010 streams in case of SW library usage.
-   `-low_latency` and `–сalc_latency` options should be used with H.264 streams having exactly 1 slice per frame. Preferable streams for an adequate latency estimate are generated by **Conferencing Sample**. The options are also effective for JPEG\* input streams. For all other input formats application would return an error.

-   If overlay is not supported by your hardware or software you won’t be able to render the decoded MVC stream.


-   Application may return error for some MJPEG streams decoded with option –low\_latency.

-   In case of using HEVC plugin \(h265 video type\), only software implementation of that plugin is used by default \(even if you provide -hw option\). To force usage of HEVC HW plugin implementation, please use -p option with proper plugin GUID.

-   VP8 HW decoding is not working if system memory is used.

-   SW HEVC plugin in 10bit mode cannot be used together with HW library VPP. Although library allows that, this is bad practice because additional per-pixel data shift is required. Please use HW HEVC + HW library or SW HEVC + SW library instead.

-   Low latency mode \(-low\_latency\) is not compatible with HEVC decoder.
-   Sample may exit with wrong status code \(MFX\_MORE\_SURFACE\) and messages

    \[ERROR\], sts=MFX\_ERR\_MORE\_SURFACE\(-11\), RunDecoding, Unexpected error!!

    \[ERROR\], sts=MFX\_ERR\_MORE\_SURFACE\(-11\), main, Pipeline.RunDecoding failed

    This may occur when number of outputted frames becomes equal to number of frames specified by "-n <frames\>" command line parameter while current status is MFX\_MORE\_SURFACE. No negative side effects present, requested number of frames are properly decoded.

-   Sample may not function properly on systems that have a non-Intel VGA controller as the first \(primary\) because Intel device is not first in the list.

    To workaround this issue, swap names of DRI device files:

    `$ cd /dev && mv card0 tmp && mv card1 card0 && mv tmp card1`

    and do the same for the files `control64/65` and `renderD128/129`
