# Video Processing \(VPP\) Sample

## Overview

**VPP Sample** works with **IntelÂ® Media SDK** \(hereinafter referred to as "**SDK**"\).

It demonstrates how to use the **SDK** API to create a simple console application that performs video processing of raw video sequences.

## Features

**VPP Sample** supports the following video formats:

|Format type| |

```
$ sample_vpp -sw 352 -sh 144 -scc yv12 -dw 320 -dh 240 -dcc nv12
-i input.yv12 -o output.nv12

```

```
$ sample_vpp -lib hw -scc nv12 -dcc nv12 -composite
parameters.par -o out.yuv

The example of parameters.par:
primarystream=input_720x480.yuv
width=720
height=480
cropx=0
cropy=0
cropw=720
croph=480
dstx=0
dsty=0
dstw=720
dsth=480
stream=input_480x320.yuv
width=480
height=320
cropx=0
cropy=0
cropw=480
croph=320
dstx=100
dsty=100
dstw=320
dsth=240
```

Please, also pay attention on âRunning the Softwareâ section of `<installfolder>/Media_Samples_Guide.md` document where you will find important notes on backend specific usage \(drm and x11\).

## Known Limitations

-   Streams composition works only on the IntelÂ® XeonÂ® processor E3-1200 v3 product family with hardware **SDK** library.

-   Output cropping may be ignored in streams composition for now.

-   Sample may not function properly on systems that have a non-Intel VGA controller as the first \(primary\) because Intel device is not first in the list.

    To workaround this issue, swap names of DRI device files:

    `$ cd /dev && mv card0 tmp && mv card1 card0 && mv tmp card1`

    and do the same for the files `control64/65` and `renderD128/129`
