# Media Samples Guide

These samples demonstrate how to use the Intel Media SDK API.


## What's New

  * [License](#license)
  * Due to migration of SDK to new libva infrastructure, samples are now bound to libva.so.2 library and can be used with the latest version of SDK only.
  * New options in sample_encode:
    *  Arbitrary SEI insertion
    *  Support for interlaced HEVC encoding
    *  Intra Refresh options are added
    *  Weighted Prediction options are added
  * New options in sample_multi_transcode:
    * Support for transcoding with interlaced HEVC (as source and/or destination)
    * Weighted Prediction options are added
  * Chroma siting option is added to sample_vpp.
  * New measurements using -stat option
  * Target MSDK API version is 1.34


## Package contents



**Video Decoding Sample**

Console application which performs decoding of elementary compressed video stream to raw frames. Includes the following features:

  *   decoding of HEVC \(High Efficiency Video Coding\) video via **HEVC Decoder**
  *   decoding with video post processing \(color conversion\) of raw video sequences
  *   If X11 display is available, can render output with -r 

**Video Encoding Sample**

Console application which performs encoding of raw video frames into elementary compressed stream. Includes the following features:

  * video resizing
  * video rotation via User Plug-in Sample
  * encoding HEVC video


**Video Processing Sample**

Console application which performs various video processing algorithms on raw frames.

**Video Transcoding Sample**

Console application which performs transcoding of elementary video stream from one compressed format to another. Includes the following features:

  * multiple video streams transcoding
  * video resizing, de-interlacing
  * video rotation via User Plug-in Sample
  * video rotation via User Plug-in Sample using OpenCL
  * video processing using VPP algorithms


**Metrics Monitor**

Metrics Monitor is a user space shared library and sample for Linux that provides applications access to a number of metrics from the GPU kernel mode driver to aid in understanding the state of the Intel GPU for Media workloads.

The Metrics Monitor library collects the following i915 kernel mode driver performance counters data:

  * Amount of time each GPU Engine spent executing tasks
  * Average actual GPU frequency

Metrics Monitor allows to monitor the following GPU hardware units:

  * Render engine (execution units)
  * Multi-Format CODEC (MFX)
  * Video Quality Engine
  * Blitter engine

**FEI Encoding Samples**

Console applications using SDK FEI API \(Flexible Encoder Interface\).

NOTE: Intel does not provide technical support for the FEI through forum or Intel Premier Support.  Building an application with FEI may take significantly more effort compared to the standard Media SDK API.  FEI validation is limited. Some combinations of encoding parameters may lead to unstable application behavior, crashes and hangs.  FEI API is not backward compatible

  *  **sample\_fei** showcases use of AVC FEI
  *  **sample\_hevc\_fei** showcases usage of HEVC FEI for regular encodings and transcodings. Includes basic constructions for HEVC FEI enabling.
  *  **sample\_hevc\_fei\_abr** demonstrates how to construct Look Ahead BRC for transcoding scenarios using HEVC FEI. Includes statistics stream out from encoded stream which influence low-level HEVC FEI encoder decision for quality tuning. Also supports 1:N transcoding.




## Software & Hardware Requirements


**Hardware:**

Hardware requirements are the same as for the SDK


**Software:**

Software requirements are the same as for the SDK



## Build Instructions for Linux


By default samples are built as part of building the SDK.

Samples build can be disabled by adding -DBUILD_SAMPLES=OFF to cmake command line.

 
After build binaries are in \<build folder\> \__bin/release
