Steps:
 - Please follow guidelines (see doc/Coding_guidelines.md) in your code
 - Validate that your changes don't break a build. See [build instruction](./README.md#how-to-build)
 - Pass [testing](#testing)
 - Wait while your patchset is reviewed and tested by our internal validation cycle

# Testing

## Requirements

Python* 3.5 is required to run tests. The following instruction assumes that Intel Media SDK cloned to `~/msdk` folder.

## How to test your changes

### 1. Rename system-wide Intel Media SDK libraries:

```sh
cd /opt/intel/mediasdk/lib64
# rename all libmfx*, for example:
sudo mv libmfxhw64.so libmfxhw64.so.default

cd /opt/intel/mediasdk/plugins/
# rename all plugins, for example:
sudo mv libmfx_hevcd_hw64.so libmfx_hevcd_hw64.so.default
sudo mv libmfx_h264la_hw64.so libmfx_h264la_hw64.so.default
sudo mv libmfx_hevce_hw64.so libmfx_hevce_hw64.so.default
sudo mv libmfx_vp8d_hw64.so libmfx_vp8d_hw64.so.default
```

### 2. Build original version of open-source Intel Media SDK and samples

```sh
cd ~/msdk
export MFX_HOME=`pwd`
perl tools/builder/build_mfx.pl --cmake=intel64.make.release
make -j8 -C __cmake/intel64.make.release
```

### 3. Collect gold results

```sh
cd ~/msdk/tests
python3.5 ted.py --gold
```

### 4. Apply changes to Intel Media SDK, commit them, and rebuild library and samples

### 5. Run tests once again to compare with gold results

```sh
python3.5 ted.py
```

All tests should pass. If not, you need to provide an explanation of why streams generated using the modified library are not bit-exact with the original ones.

### 6. Attach generated test_results.json to your pull request.
